<!-- 
Situation:
Working on a popular social platform called Fret-it 
<image>
The site already has four webpages with content in them:
index.html, aliens.html, e-tea.html and ufo.html but no
links to them.


Task:
Add an unordered list of links inside index.html so
that users can navigate to other pages from the homepage.
