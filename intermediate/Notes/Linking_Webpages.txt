   or the user's profile picture.
2. Set the image width and height to "300".
3. Add a hyperlink to the word "here".
4. We'll set a link to a 404 page for now. A new html file named "404.html" has been added.
   It contains an nested h3 element with username and a seperate nested h3 and paragraph
   which says "404 - Page not found!" and "That's an ooooppsieee!" respectively.
