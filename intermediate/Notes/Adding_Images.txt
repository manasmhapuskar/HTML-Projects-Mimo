Situation:
A friend is working on a page of their blog where
they're keeping a track of their Erasmus trips. 
Here's the design:
1. One heading named "Erasmus Trips".
2. Three images one below another of same size.


Task:
Unfortunately, the img elements seem to be broken.
Help them out fixing the code.
<!doctype html>

    <body>
        <h3>
            Erasmus Trips
        </h3>
