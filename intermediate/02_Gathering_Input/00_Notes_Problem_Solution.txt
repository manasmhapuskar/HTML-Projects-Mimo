Situation:
Use your knowledge of input elements to code a signup page
like the one below:
<image>

 
Task:
Use placeholders to tell users where to type in their email
and password, and a checkbox to let new users sign up for 
email updates.


Actions:
*. Code the doctype, html & body tags.
1. Start with a h4 heading displaying "Company Name".
2. Code two input elements so that one displays below the other.
3. To let users know where to enter in their email, let's set
   the placeholder to "Email".
4. Now, set the placeholder for the second input to "Password".
5. To keep curious eyes from seeing the password a user types in,
   set the input field's input to password.
6. Add a line break to the bottom of your webpage.
7. Then, create an input element checkbox below it.
8. Besides the checkbox, tell the users what they're agreeing to
   by emphasizing text near to it.
9. Add a line break.
10. Then, code a button displaying Sign up at the bottom of the webpage.
11. Lastly, try replacing "Company Name" and "Send me updates" with text
    of your choice.

Situation:
Using input and image elements, we can build interesting
interfaces for settings 

 
Task:
Apply your knowledge on those elements to build an interface
for computer settings like one below:
<image> 


Action:
*. Code the doctype, html & body elements.
1. Start by creating an h4 heading "Settings".
2. Next, display a paragraph for the brightness setting,
   an image, and an input element.
3. Since, we want a smaller icon next to our input elements,
   set the image's width attribute to 20.
4. Now add the icon image's source:
   "https://mimo.app/i/brightness-icon.png"
5. For adjusting brightness, it's common to use an input element
   with range.
6. Now it's time for Volume Setting. Use paragraph to give it 
   a label
7. Now, create a image with it's width set to 20.
8. Set the source of the 2nd image:
   "https://mimo.app/i/volume-icon.png"
9. Add the last input element of range.

Situation:
Recently a group of developers was hired to build
the newsletter subscription page shown below:
<image> 


Task:
Unfortunately, those developers didn't practice their
input elements and the webpage now looks like this.
<image>
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h3>Sign up for Newsletters</h3>
        <input>
        <em>The Daily Crunch</em>
        <input>
        Startups Weekly
        <p>
            By clicking Subscribe you agree to our 
            <a href = "https://getmimo.com">Terms of Service</a>
        </p>
        <button>Subscribe</button>
    </body>
</html>
Let's fix it. 


Action:
1. Start by setting the type of all input elements to checkbox.
2. Let the input elements appear on different lines.
3. The developers left out the third option. First add a line break.
   Code the third input with type checkbox.
4. Add an emphasized label to the third checkbox displaying "Event Updates".
5. To sign users up with an email, display an input element with a 
   placeholder set to "Email" to the left of subscribe button.
