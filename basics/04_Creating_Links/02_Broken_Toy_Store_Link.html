<!-- 
Situation:
A new company, TOYS'R'U has just developed a new website.
Here's the design for what it was supposed to like,
1. A heading with text "TOYS'R'U!"
2. A paragraph with the text "Welcome to TOYS'R'U,
     where all you need is your imagination!"
3. A link named "New Toys" on the new line.
4. Followed by the text, "Follow the link to see your
   newest toy design" on the next line.
5. Next, three links named "About Us, Privacy & Jobs" 


Task:
Unfortunately, the developers who built it made a few mistakes.
